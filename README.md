# Sociometric-Badge
This project is to design and implement data collection package of an more economic, up-to-date and powerful alternative solution to original embedded Sociometric Badge. The project is designed for Android platform, especially smart phone with Android OS. When we use our smartphone to realize the functionality of the Sociometric Badge, which is a wearable sensing device that can be used to study human behavior and social interactions, one key element is getting all the data from sensors in the smartphone.  This project is supposed to be a layer between Android provided API and the App developed to control our badges so to make the sensor related part easy to accomplish. With this project, researchers can easily get information about badge carriersâ€™ body movement, posture, speaking turn, speed, frequency and amplitude of voice, interaction and identification between badge carriers and even environment features. Android platform application developing is needed.
